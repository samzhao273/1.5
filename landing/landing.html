I know the past couple months / weeks have been a bit rough but I still feel so happy with you and I apologize for putting you in a situation where you’re fighting by yourself. I promise it will never happen again. Over the past two years, I have never realized how much I can like ,love and cherish someone.  I am just a baby in this big boy big girl relationship and I’m sorry to have put you in positions that no one should go through. I am forever appreciative of how understanding, nice, loving, and sweet you are. I know that I have a lot of Issues that I need to deal with and I appreciate you so so so much for being here with me and supporting me every step of the way. I cannot wait for you to come to SF hehe and see me or me come up to see you hehe and for your first part of your gift you cant check out the website!!   I’m really sorry it is updated but the bigger update is still a work in progress ( it is a bit big) so I’m really sorry but I promise it will be done before we leave!  I love you and my answer is no. I don’t believe our love is 1 in a million, but 1 in a million lifetimes <3 ♡";
